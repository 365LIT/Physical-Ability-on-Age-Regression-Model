# Physical-Ability-on-Age-Regression-Model
# The file already contains information regarding what it is supposed to do. 
The purpose of the project is to see if age is statistically significant to physical ability, or how much people could do sit ups. If it is, then I wanted to see if had any omitted variables that is causing the effect. 
In order to identify I made:
two histograms, 
a statistics summary,
a scatter plot,
a multivariate regression model,
a correlation matrix.
In conclusion, there were omitted variables affecting the result. Even when someone is relatively old compared to others, he/she can still excel more than the younger ones because there are other factors affecting people.
